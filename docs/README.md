## Project Management Process — Overview

OctoAcme’s approach combines a customer-first mindset, iterative delivery, and strong documentation for successful projects. Initiatives start with a lightweight One-pager that clarifies the problem, goals, success metrics, stakeholders, and a high-level timeline, with a decision gate requiring clear metrics and stakeholder buy-in before planning.

Planning breaks work into a prioritized, estimated backlog (using a standard template and Definition of Done), identifies dependencies in a Risk Register, and maps out releases and milestones. Execution is tracked on a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done), with a workflow emphasizing small PRs, clear acceptance criteria, automated testing, required code reviews, and QA.

Releases are standardized with checklists for planning, deployment, verification, and rollback, and include robust communication and documentation of each release. Regular demos, stakeholder updates, and retrospectives drive transparency and continuous improvement.

**Roles are defined as follows:**  
- **Product Manager (PdM):** Owns product vision, metrics, and prioritization  
- **Project Manager (PM):** Coordinates delivery, risks, and communication  
- **Developers:** Build, test, and deliver features meeting criteria  
- **QA:** Validate quality and requirements  
- **Stakeholders:** Provide feedback and approvals

Communication happens via structured standups, weekly syncs, milestone demos, and dashboards for metrics, velocity, and health. Retrospectives after each sprint or release ensure the process continuously improves, with learnings added to the backlog and shared with the team.
